# TextMeBaby
This is a Python script that executes a command and sends notifications using the Twilio API when the command execution completes or fails.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or create a new Python script with the provided code.
  
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install twilio
   ```

3. Create a `config.py` file in the same directory as your script. Include your Twilio credentials and phone numbers as follows:

   ```python
   # config.py

   twilio_account_sid = 'your_account_sid'
   twilio_auth_token = 'your_auth_token'
   twilio_phone_number = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
   your_phone_number = 'your_phone_number'
   ```

4. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python script.py <command_to_execute>
   ```

   Replace `<command_to_execute>` with the command you want to execute.

## Features

- Executes a given command using the `subprocess` module.
- Sends notifications using the Twilio API when the command execution succeeds or fails.
- Limits the length of command output to a maximum of 100 characters in notifications.

## Notes

- Replace the placeholders in the `config.py` file with your actual Twilio credentials and phone numbers.
- Make sure to install the Twilio Python library using `pip install twilio`.
- Customize the retry mechanism or exception handling as needed for your use case.
